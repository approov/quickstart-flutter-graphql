# Approov Flutter GraphQL Todo App

[Approov](https://approov.io) is an API security solution used to verify that requests received by your backend services originate from trusted versions of your mobile apps.

This is an Approov integration quickstart example for a mobile app built with Flutter and using GraphQL.

## Credits

The base for this Todo app is borrowed from the [hasura/learn-graphql](https://github.com/hasura/learn-graphql/tree/c39f7731c609fb24c10a66c8ee574b4cb02f9a41/tutorials/mobile/flutter-graphql/app-final) repo, that has a [MIT license](https://github.com/hasura/learn-graphql/blob/c39f7731c609fb24c10a66c8ee574b4cb02f9a41/LICENSE), that is also on this repo. The Hasura repo is full of tutorials and examples that can be useful to start learning GraphQL or to sharp your knowledge on it.
